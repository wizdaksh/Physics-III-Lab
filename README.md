# PHYS 263: University Physics III Laboratory
**George Mason University | Spring 2026**

## Course Overview
This repository contains the experimental designs, data visualizations, and statistical analyses completed for the University Physics III Laboratory. The course emphasizes four key aspects of experimental physics: designing experiments, developing technical laboratory skills, analyzing data using high-level programming (Python), and communicating results.

## Core Competencies
* **Experimental Design**: Engineering and troubleshooting experiments within constraints such as cost, time, and safety.
* **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Utilizing **Python** to interpret the validity, limitations, and uncertainties of results.
* **Scientific Programming**: Implementing numerical methods (NumPy) to characterize physical phenomena and filter sensor noise.
* **Technical Communication**: Presenting evidence-based arguments through formal written reports and oral presentations.

## Exercise Units
The following units represent the core curriculum and the evolution of the experimental data tracked in this repository:

1. **Measurement, Uncertainty, and Scientific Programming**
   - Introduction to statistical methods and Python-based data characterization.
2. **Characterizing the Atmosphere**
   - Analysis of atmospheric variables and sensor calibration using mobile hardware.
3. **Pressure and Temperature**
   - Experimental verification of the Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT) using a sealed jar.
4. **Total Internal Reflection**
   - Investigating the boundary conditions of light at refractive interfaces.
5. **Calibrating a Function Generator**
   - Signal analysis and equipment precision testing.
6. **Measuring a Refractive Index**
   - Determining optical properties of various media.
7. **Light Intensity and Distance**
   - Mapping the inverse-square law for electromagnetic radiation.

## Methodology & Uncertainty
Every quantitative measurement in this repository is defined by an interval of uncertainty, following the standards outlined in the lab manual:
* **Type A Uncertainty**: Evaluated through statistical analysis of repeated measurements.
* **Type B Uncertainty**: Evaluated through scientific judgment, instrument specifications, and environmental systematic effects (e.g., heat radiation from hardware or volume displacement).

## Technology Stack
* **Language**: Python 3.11.9
* **Libraries**: 
  - **NumPy**: For data manipulaiton
  - **Matplotlib**: For generating publication-quality scientific plots.
* **Tools**: VS Code, Git/GitHub for Version Control.
